# mushmap
## A Python implementation of a multidimensional space as a directed graph.

This came out of a discussion on mapping spaces of two or more dimensions.  Being an old MUD player, and having worked on a MUSH, I conceived of it as rooms with exits in directions.  This starts to feel to me like a directed graph.

I'm sure there's a lot already known about this that I haven't researched.  I'm just going to bang on some implementation and see how that starts to shape up.
